				        		<p>
					        		Anna Bartoux is a second year dual BA student at Sciences Po Paris and Columbia University. Born and raised in France, she later moved to the United States, where she developed a fascination for transatlantic relations and diplomacy.  She hopes to focus her academic career on conflict resolution at the international level to later work in organizations such as the UN. As a political junkie and a history lover, she is also passionate about the dynamics of global change, so the theme “Age of Change” seemed perfect for this innovative conference. Anna is a self-diagnosed workaholic, and her friends sometimes joke that she spends way too much time on LinkedIn.
